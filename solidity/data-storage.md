# Storage

1. storage: The state variables are storage by default, which are stored on-chain.
2. memory: The parameters and temporary variables in the function generally use memory label, which is stored in memory and not on-chain.
3. calldata: Similar to memory, stored in memory, not on-chain. The difference from memory is that calldata variables cannot be modified
